\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Dr. Andrew Smith and Dr. James Hicks for advising,
mentoring, and tutoring me; each unique in their approach, but common in
their passion to push science forward.  SMURF-seq would not have been
possible without the help and hundreds of hours of discussion with Dr.
Liya Xu. Thank you.

I would like to thank my committee members Dr. Mark Chaisson, Dr.
Michael Waterman, and Dr. Jorge Nieva for their guidance and advice on
this research.

I am extremely grateful to all the members of SmithLab, past and
present, for their scientific and non-scientific support.  I would also
like to thank the members of Kuhn-Hicks lab for the numerous useful
discussions.
