\section{Prior protocols based on concatenating DNA molecuels}
% SAGE and its variants
The concept of ligating short DNA molecueles to improve the efficiency
of sequencing was introduced in serial analysis of gene expresson
(SAGE) \cite{}, and subsequenty its variants such as LongSAGE and
SuperSAGE \cite{}. SAGE
