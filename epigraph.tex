\epigraph{Individuals are not stable things, they are fleeting. Chromosomes too
are shuffled into oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But
the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. The genes
are not destroyed by crossing-over, they merely change partners and march on.
Of course they march on. That is their business. They are the replicators and
we are their survival machines. When we have served our purpose we are cast
aside. But genes are denizens of geological time: genes are forever.}
